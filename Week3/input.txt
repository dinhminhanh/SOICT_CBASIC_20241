ermissions can be granted during installation or runtime, 
depending on protection level. 
Each permission has a protection level: normal, signature, or 
dangerous.
For permissions granted during runtime, prompt users to 
explicitly grant or deny access to your app.
Prompt the user to grant the permission when they try to 
access functionality that requires a dangerous permission. 
Explain to the user why the permission is needed. 
Fall back gracefully if the user denies the permission (app 
should still function)
